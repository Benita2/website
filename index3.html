<td style="background-color:grey ; width:50% ; padding: 50px"><h1 style="text-align:center">Why Not Codenation?!!!</h1>

<p>
Having done research on CodeNaton I found they have fun learning environment and 
interesting courses as well opportnities for job prospects. I also like the idea that
they are trying to change the narrative by getting more women into I.T. The fact that they
are backed up by recruitment companies is another plus for me.

</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Purpose of I.T in Modern Business</h1>
<div>
<br>
<br\>
<p>Technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of
your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will
help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. Technological
infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business.
It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages.
</p>
</div>

<p>First and foremost, technology affects a firm’s ability to communicate with customers. In
today’s busy business environment, it is necessary for employees to interact with
clients quickly and clearly. Websites allow customers to find answers to their questions
after hours. Fast shipment options allow businesses to move products over a large
geographic area. When customers use technology to interact with a business, the business
benefits because better communication creates a stronger public image.</p>>

<p>Technology also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious
resources such as time and physical space. Warehouse inventory technologies let busines
                
owners understand how best to manage the storage costs of holding a product. With proper
technology in place, executives can save time and money by holding meetings over the
Internet instead of at corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>Technology creates a team dynamic within a business because employees at different
locations have better interactions. If factory managers can communicate with shipment
coordinators at a different location, tensions and distrust are less likely to evolve.
Cliques and social tensions can become a nightmare for a business; technology often
helps workers put their different backgrounds aside.</p>
<p>Most businesses of the modern era are subject to security threats and vandalism.
Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive decisions and
other proprietary information that leads to competitive advantages. Simply put,
technology helps businesses keep their ideas away from their competition. By having
computers with passwords, a business can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be
copied by the competition.</p>
<p>A business that has the technological capacity to research new opportunities will stay a
step ahead of its competition. For a business to survive, it must grow and acquire new
opportunities. The Internet allows a business to virtually travel into new markets
without the cost of an executive jet or the risks of creating a factory abroad.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Methods, skills and resources needed for digital projects</h1>
            
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Although are different methods to completing a project, some of the most common ones include:

<p>The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development.This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software.
It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints. </ul>
<p>
<p>Scrum is a type of agile methodology. It is essentially an agile process framework. In fact, Scrum and Kanban in software development terms are both specific flavors or types of an agile software methodology. ... Scrum is just one of the many iterative and incremental agile software development method.</p>

<p>
Waterfall is a step by step approach where all requirements are fixed until final
delivery.This is considered a “traditional” project management technique and itself nicely
nicely to projects where both schedule and scope are fixed, as all requirements are clearly 
defined in Waterfall at the beginning of the project, without much (or any) room for change.

<p>
            
Whatever project management method you use for projects with a fixed deadline, like
campaigns, there needs to be some flexibility on other elements of the project.
Flexibility in either scope or cost will help ensure you meet an ever-looming deadline
and determine the best approach to delivering a successful campaign. A useful rule of
thumb is that campaigns with a fixed scope are better suited to waterfall-style
management, while Agile is better for fixed-cost campaigns.</p>
<p>        
<br>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>Digital Project managers, in the simplest sense, ensure things get done in a digital world. 
They make sure that the digital plan of action is executed according to theplan they have laid out.
A digital project manager often combines a brand's online resources and human resources to create 
effective marketing campaigns.
</p>
<h1>Resources</h1>
<li>Specify your requirements. Either brainstorm and work out what you need, or save
yourself time by using Axia’s Accounting, CRM, HR, Payroll or HR+Payroll Checklists.
</li>
<li>Review software details, vendor responses. Compare against outline requirements.
Identify a short list of 3 or 4 potential vendors that meet your requirements.
</li>
<li>Attend system demonstrations with vendors. Confirm that the systems can meet your
requirements. Reduce the list down to 2 or 3 preferred vendors with which to proceed
further.
</li>
<li>Refine your new system design thoughts - from what you have seen and heard, and from
your original ideas / requirements.
</li>
<li>Prepare and issue an extended RFI or RFP containing your detailed requirements to
the preferred vendors. Carefully review and evaluate the responses.</li>
<li>Undertake further investigations - of all areas / relevant aspects of the software.
Test and prototype system software - especially for complex requirements. Examine
other areas eg hardware, network, database, system performance.
</li>
<li>Attend detailed system demonstrations and meetings. Cover and resolve all points,
issues and queries from the above with the preferred vendors.
</li>
<li>Reference site visits. Visit at least 3 reference sites (and phone 3 more) of the
preferred vendors. Listen and learn from their experiences.
</li>
<li>Decision. From reviewing all the above information, it should be clear as to which
system to purchase. Commence final negotiation, contractual and service level
negotiations.
</li>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Planning your website</h1>  

<p>Planning my website was a bit of a daunting process.I use Trello to set an objectives
  and to create content strategy </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Why Projects fail </h1>
<p>There may be various reasons why I.T projects fails.But the three most common ones include:
    scope, schedule and cost. These three constraint are interdependent as none of three
    can be altered without affecting each other. For example, if the scope of a
    project increases, it is likely to longer and/ or cost more.Likewise and earlier deadline
    is almost certain to either require more money or a less ambitious scope.

<h1 style="text-align:center">Legal guideline and constraint that impact digital projects</h1>
<div>
    <br>
<h1>GDPR</h1>
<p>Individuals, organisations, and companies that are either 'controllers' or 'processors' of personal data will be covered by the GDPR. "If you are currently subject to the DPA, it is likely that you will also be subject to the GDPR," the ICO says on its website.

        By MATT BURGESS
        
        Both personal data and sensitive personal data are covered by GDPR. Personal data, a complex category of information, broadly means a piece of information that can be used to identify a person.
         This can be a name, address, IP address... you name it. Sensitive personal data encompasses genetic data, information about religious and political views, sexual orientation, and more.
        
        The definitions are largely the same as those that were previously included in data protection laws. Where GDPR differentiates from current data protection laws is that pseudonymised personal data can fall under the law – if it's possible that a person could be identified by a pseudonym.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">How you planned your Project</h1>

<p>I have planned my project using the Trello board to set out a plan and strategy</p>

<h1 style="text-align:centre"> Disability and Accessing webpages</h1>


<p>In the UK, one in five people has a disability. While not all disabilities affect access to the web, many do.
 As we age many of us find it harder to read small print or we see colour in a different way, making the web site better for those with disabilities helps everyone.

some may use Dragon or Jaws speech readers, and ZoomText to increase text size. 
.Others may navigate a website with the keyboard only, or even use a combination of techniques to get around the web.
 </p>    

<h1 style="text-align:center">Legal guidelines and constrainst that impact digital projects</h1>           
<p>Copyright infringement affects websites because they may contain intellectual properties that have
been protect the owners.This is why it is important to obtain permission from the owners of the intellectual
property, to use thier work. And also get persmission to publish

<h1>Describe whether the I.T tools selected were appropriate</h1>
I did not use codpen. However,
<ol> 
    <ul>
        <li>visual code useful for codsing the website very usefull.</li>
        <li>Trello was very usefull for mapping out a plan for the website</li>         

    </ul>
</ol>

<h1>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project </h1>
<p>As coding is a completely new concept to me , I think I am proud of what I have achieved
    so far on my website so far.I would say my strengths is being able to use and navigate
    my way arround the Trello board ans aspect of the Visual code. I think I can improve
    on using the GitHub. I found it very tricky.
</p>
<h1>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h1>
<p>Website was launched and tested on Chrome and Safari. Both worked fine</p>
